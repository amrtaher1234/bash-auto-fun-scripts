# bash-auto-fun-scripts
This is a repo inspired by Hacker Scripts. It is just some scripts that will be mainly used for automating stuff in my environment.

## angular run
This is a very basic script. it creates an angular application like the normal ng new command, in addition to that
it creates a core folder containing a core module, adds routing and sass as default styling and add a shared folder with 
sub folders of authentication and components.
